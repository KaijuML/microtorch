# minitorch

Miniversion of Pytorch for practice purposes.

A lot of the code for the autograd portion of this repo comes from [autograd](https://github.com/joelgrus/autograd), written by Joel Gruss.

I have added a number of functionalities: Modules, Optimizers, etc. Also, I feel like things are better organised here!

# Usage

I have included two notebooks where I show how the library can be used. As it turns out, exactly like Pytorch!

- In `simple_function.ipynb` we learn a simple linear function using only ten training points
- In `xor.ipynb` we learn to solve the xor, which is not linear, using Tanh
